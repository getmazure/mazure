Welcome to the Mazure documentation!
====================================

**Mazure** is a proxy that mocks the Azure SDK.

Using a mocked Azure will, as a developer:
 - Save you time, as you no longer have to wait for long-running HTTP-requests to Microsofts' servers
 - Save you time, as you no longer have to write your own mocks
 - Gain you confidence that you're using the Azure SDK correctly
